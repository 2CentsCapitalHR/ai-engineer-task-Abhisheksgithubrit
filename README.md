ðŸ“Œ Overview
The ADGM Corporate Agent is an AI-powered legal assistant designed to help businesses and professionals prepare and review incorporation and compliance documentation for the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) jurisdiction.
It uses Document Intelligence + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to verify document completeness, detect compliance issues, and provide actionable suggestions.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project was built to:

Automate document checklist verification for ADGM processes (e.g., Company Incorporation)

Detect legal red flags and inconsistencies

Provide inline comments & legal references directly in .docx documents

Reduce manual legal review time while ensuring compliance with ADGM regulations

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Process Detection â€“ Automatically detects the legal process (e.g., "Company Incorporation") from uploaded documents.
âœ… Checklist Verification â€“ Compares uploaded .docx files against official ADGM requirements and identifies missing documents.
âœ… Red Flag Detection â€“ Flags invalid clauses, missing jurisdiction details, ambiguous language, and non-compliance.
âœ… Inline Comments â€“ Inserts comments in the .docx at the exact location of issues, citing ADGM laws/regulations.
âœ… RAG Integration â€“ Uses ADGM official documents and templates for accurate compliance checks.
âœ… Structured Output â€“ Generates a JSON/Python report summarizing:
